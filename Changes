    - Allow hash references to be used as sets, as well as array
      refs. Acknowledgements to Ken Williams for this suggestion.
    - Examples added to the documentation, and corrected the example
      given in the synopsis.
    - Performance boost: store an array [0 1 2 ... n], which
      is cheaper than constructing 0..$#$list in next().

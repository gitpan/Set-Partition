TESTING

This module requires the following modules for thorough testing:

    Test::More
    Test::Pod
    Test::Pod::Coverage

It can also make use of Devel::Cover if available.

UNINSTALLATION

This is a pure-Perl module. The following one-liner should print
out the canonical path of the file:

  perl -MSet::Partition -le 'print $INC{"Set/Partition.pm"}'

Just delete this file. There is also the question of the man page.
Finding that is left as an exercise to the reader.

USAGE

use Set::Partition;

my $s = Set::Partition->new(
	list      => [1..20],
	partition => [6, 5, 3, 3, 3],
);

while (my $p = $s->next) {
    print join( ' ', map { "(@$_)" } @$p ), $/;
}

STATUS
